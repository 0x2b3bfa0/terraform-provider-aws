## Triage

Incoming issues are classified using labels. These are assigned either by automation, or manually during the triage process. We follow a two-label system where we classify by type and by the area of the provider they affect. A full listing of the labels and how they are used can be found in the [Label Dictionary](label-dictionary.md).
